### Getting Help

- Learned:
  - `man date` manual page for the command
  - `/file` inside the manual page search the document for the search string
  - `man -k password` Display a summary of all man pages that have the keyword "password"
  - `apropos password` same as man -k option
  - `man -f passwd` Display multiple man pages with same name
  - `man 5 passwd` it is example
  - `whatis passwd` same as man -f option
  - `info date` it like manual page but it easier to read
  - `date --help` to view basic command usage
  - `ls /usr/share/doc` - more detailed help documents available in directory.

### Finding file

- Learned:
  - `locate crontab` - easy way to search files
  - `find ~/Projects/ -type f -name "*.md"` - find is a powerful and versatile tool used to search for file and directories
