# Where data stored

    A typical Linux system has thousands of files. The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard provides a guideline for distributions on how to organize these files.
    It is important to understand the role of the Linux kernel and how its both processes and provides information about the system under the /proc and /sys pseudo filesystems.

### Processes

- Learned:
  - `/proc` - contains information about running process, system hardware and current kernel configuration.
  - `/dev` - contains hardware devices files
  - `/sys` - devices information can be found in this directory
  - `ls /proc` - inside numbered directory for each running process
  - `/proc/cmdline` - Information that was passed to the kernel when it was first started, such as command line parameters and special instructions
  - `/proc/meminfo` - Information about the use of memory by the kernel
  - `/pro/modules` - A list of modules loaded into the kernel to add extra funcionality

### Process Hierarchy

- Learned:
  - `/sbin/init` - the init process in System V-based system.
  - `/bin/systemd` - the init process in SystemMd-based system
  - `cat /proc/sys/kernel/pid_max` - maximum PID value
  - `pstree` - Print process family tree

### Viewing Process Snaphot

- Learned:
  - `ps` - print current running processes
  - `ps --forest` - similar to pstree
  - `ps aux | head` - view all process on the system
  - `ps -ef | grep firefox` - using grep specific process
  - `ps -u root` - view individual user's processes

### Viewing Processes in Real Time

- Learned:
  - `ps` - command provides a snapshot of the processes
  - `top` - output real-time running processes
  - `cat /proc/loadavg` - it report load average to the number of cpu cores that are able to execute processes.

### Log Files

- Learned:
  - `boot.log` - During the startup of the system
  - `cron` - Messages generated by the crond daemon for jobs to be executed on a recurring basis.
  - `dmesg` - Kernel log during system boot up.
  - `maillog` - mail daemon for e-mail messages sent or received.
  - `messages` - kernel and other processes
  - `secure` - authorization or authentication
  - `journal` - systemd-journald.service is centerlized log
  - `Xorg.0.log` - Gui server logs
  - `file /var/log/btmp` - binary log file

### Kernel Messages

- Learned:
  - Kernel messages stored in dmesg during system startup
  - dmesg 512 kilobytes of text , so filtering
  - `dmesg | grep -i usb`

### Filesystem Hierarchy Standard

- Learned:
  - `/` - The base of the structure or root of the filesystem
  - `/bin` - Essential command-line binaries
  - `/boot` - Essential files needed to start your system before the kernel begins
  - `/dev` - Special device files that represent hardware devices and provide interface to kernel drivers.
  - `/etc` - Essential system configuration files that control how the operating system and its services behave.
  - `/home` - User home directory
  - `/lib` - Essential shared libraries that support the executeable files in /bin and /sbin
  - `/lib64` - Essential libraries built for specific architecture
  - `/media` - Mount point for removable media mounted automatically
  - `/mnt` - Mount point for temporarily mounting filesystems manually
  - `/opt` - Optionla third-party software installation location
  - `/proc` - Virtual fiesystem for the kernel to report process information
  - `/root` - Home directory of the root user
  - `/sbin` - Essential system binaries primarly user by the root user
  - `/sys` - Virtual filesystem for information about hardware devices connected to the system
  - `/srv` - Location where site-specific services may be hosted
  - `/tmp` - Create temporary files
  - `/usr` - Non-essential files for multi-user use
  - `/usr/local` - Files for software not originating from distribution
  - `/var` - Varaible data files that change over time
  - `/var/cache` - For caching application data
  - `/var/log` - Most log files
  - `/var/lock` - Lock files for shared resources
  - `/var/spool` - Spool files for printing amd mail
  - `/var/tmp` - Temporary files to be preserved between reboots

### Binary Directories
- Learned:
    - The binary directories that are intended to be used by non-privileged users include:
    - `/bin`
    - `/usr/bin`
    - `/usr/local/bin`
    - For third-party software
    - `/usr/local/application/bin`
    - `/opt/application/bin`

### Root-Restricted Binaries
- Learned:
    - sbin directories are primarily intended to be used by the system adminstrator
    - `/sbin`
    - `/usr/sbin`
    - `/usr/local/sbin`
    - For thir-party administrative applications
    - `/usr/local/application/sbin`
    - `/opt/application/sbin`

### Software Application Directories
- Learned:
    - The data for the application may be stored in 
    - `/usr/share`
    - `/usr/lib`
    - `/opt/application`
    - `/var/lib`
    - The files related to documentation
    - `/usr/share/doc`
    - `/usr/share/man`
    - `/usr/share/info`

### Libray Directories
- Learned:
    - Most library files names end in a file exension of `.so` which mean shared object
